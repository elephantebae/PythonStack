#Basic - Print all the numbers/integers from 0 to 150.

#  for num in range(0,151, 1):
    #print(num)

# Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

#for num in range(5,1000000, 5):
#    print(num)

# Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100.  If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If by 10, also print " Dojo".

#for num in range(1,101, 1):
